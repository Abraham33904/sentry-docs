Sentry integrates with your favorite apps and services. Sentry integrations are categorized as [organization level](#organization-level), [project level](#project-level), or [integration platform](#integration-platform).

## Organization Level

Set these integrations up once per organization, and they'll be available for all projects within that organization. Organization level integrations fall into two categories: integrations created by Sentry and integrations created by partners. Content for the Integration Platform is maintained by Sentry partners but linked here for your convenience.

### Integration Platform

Sentryâ€™s [Integration Platform](/product/integrations/integration-platform/) provides a way for external services to interact with the Sentry SaaS service using the REST API and webhooks. Integrations utilizing this platform are first-class actors within Sentry, and you can build them for [public](/product/integrations/integration-platform/#public-integrations) as well as [internal](/product/integrations/integration-platform/#internal-integrations) use cases.
    
These integrations are maintained and supported by the companies that created them. For more details, see the full documentation on the [Integration Platform](/product/integrations/integration-platform/).

## Project Level

These integrations are set up once per project and are only usable in projects in which they've been set up.
